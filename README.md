# Meso-chain——a hatching platform for the game based on blockchain    
　　Meso-chain, a deployment platform intergrated with development toolkit and framework,serve for every innovative game developer. By offering a series of deployment tool suite , Meso-chain let the developers deploy their side-chain network without any technical basis. And the universal framework provided by us can greatly reduce the repeated development work each game developer may encounter. Devoting ourselves to solving the technical problem our game developers are facing, we hope to see more and more excellent production will emerge.  

## Features
* Dual-chain mechanism for side-chain network system, one for circulating, and another for synchronization.
* Circulating chain possesses high TPS, employs ethereum-like framework and DPOS consensus mechanism.
* Synchronization chain demands very low TPS(about level of seconds), remains invisble for users.
* The reliability of a transfering operation between two chains is ensured by PBFT（Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance).
* SMS and Google Two-Factor authenticaton.
* Highly configurable and extendable.
* Active community behind.
* Free and open-source.
